Like...or Not Like

 
Whenever my wife and I go to a restaurant, she always asks me: “Did I like their iced tea here?”, or “What did I get the last time that I liked or didn’t like?” It never fails. Of course I can’t remember either. So is born… the personal Yelp app or Myelp.
 
My goal is to make an app that she (or anyone) can record their dining experiences such as, meals ordered, drinks ordered, appetizers, etc., and rate them. I also want to include the time of day and any other special circumstances that might have affected the quality and service.
 
I’d like to have an option to include a photo if desired.
 
USER EXPERIENCE
 
First thing I do is register. If already registered, I log in.
 
After log in, I’m taken to my home page where I find my SAVED restaurants. I can either select a saved restaurant or CREATE a new one. If I select a saved restaurant, I’m taken to a page where I have information about my PREVIOUS dining experiences. If I choose to create a new restaurant, I’m taken to a page where I can enter info about this CURRENT experience.
 
On my SAVED/PREVIOUS page, I will have info such as: name of restaurant, date, time of day, meal and drinks. Next to each item will be a thumbs up or thumbs down. There will be a button to edit the info and a place for notes.
 
On my NEW/CURRENT page, I will have info to add info such as: name of restaurant, date, time of day, meal and drinks. Next to each item will be a thumbs up or thumbs down. There will be a button to edit the info and a place for notes. When I have completed the info, there will be a button to SAVE the info.
 
I will also be able to add an image if needed or wanted.
 
For this project, I will use Angular, Materialize and Firebase.
 
As for stretch goals, I would like to use google maps to find the saved restaurants. I’d also like to be able to search through my saved restaurants via the like or not like symbol.
